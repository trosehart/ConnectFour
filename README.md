# ConnectFour
I uploaded this project just to see how to do it.  All programs are written in Java.
This program was created in 2016 for my high school computer science class.  JCanvas, Board, and Coordinate were not written by me.  Names of the authors are in their programs.

## Instructions
PegsFall is the game Connect Four.  Each player takes their turn and must click on the top row of the board in order to place a piece, just like in real life where you must drop the piece from the top.  After one player has either 4 in a row diagonally, vertically, or horizontally, the game ends with an animation.

SnakesAndLadders is just snakes and ladders.  The number of players can be chosen at the start, and then each player can choose a colour.  Each player must click the board to move their piece.  "Ladders" look like stair cases and "snakes" are the ramps.  Sound effects will not work because I never uploaded them.
